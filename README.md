# HISRON


Ultra-high-resolution imaging at the cellular level demands
solutions that can handle terabyte-scale datasets and intense computa-
tional workloads. We introduce HISRON (High-Resolution Scalable Neu-
roimaging), a GPU-accelerated framework that integrates unsupervised
learning for adaptive feature extraction, anisotropic diffusion for noise re-
duction, and promptable segmentation models with zero-shot generaliza-
tion. By incorporating a dynamic overlap-aware tiling strategy, HISRON
maximizes parallel processing without sacrificing critical spatial context,
achieving near-real-time analysis of intricate neuronal structures.
Leveraging NVIDIA CUDA and CuPy, our approach delivers a tenfold
increase in noise reduction speed over standard techniques and processes
200,000 neuron centroids in under 30 seconds—a 40% overall pipeline im-
provement. These performance gains have been validated across a multi-
institutional dataset comprising both ex vivo rodent and human corti-
cal samples, underscoring the framework’s robustness in varied research
settings. Moreover, HISRON ensures consistent segmentation accuracy
across multiple imaging protocols and resolutions, addressing fundamen-
tal challenges in large-scale and multi-center neuroscience initiatives.
Thanks to its cloud-ready architecture, HISRON accommodates geo-
graphically dispersed studies and integrates seamlessly with clinical imag-
ing pipelines, especially in neurosurgery and neuroradiology. In com-
prehensive benchmarking, our customized region growing segmentation
module outperformed advanced universal methods (FCN, U-Net, DeepLabv3,
StarDist) and Segment Anything Model (SAM) variants (Zero-Shot, Prompted),
achieving around a 2% higher Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) than
the leading universal model (StarDist) and a similar 2% improvement
over the best SAM variant (Prompted).
